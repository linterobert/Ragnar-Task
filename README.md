# Update Info

I decided to slightly change the structure of the Library table, so I changed the Genre field from a string to an enum and added all the genre types found in the two test files.

I also added two tests for the import request.

For the backend, I chose Clean Architecture, as it makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

On the frontend side, I improved the file upload experience by making the file input more responsive. I added custom validation error messages and enhanced the drag-and-drop area with a scaling animation when a file is dropped.

# Home Library - Take-Home Assignment

Welcome! **Fork this repository** and build your solution in your fork. This starter gives you the
infrastructure (PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ via Docker Compose) and sample data, so you can spend your time
on the app rather than the plumbing.

> **Target effort: ~4 hours.** We value a small, clean, working solution over a large unfinished one.
> If something is unclear, make a reasonable assumption, note it, and keep moving.

## What's in this starter

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml` | PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ, ready to run, with **commented service templates** for your API, worker, and web app to fill in. |
| `.env.example` | Environment variables used by the compose file (copy to `.env`). |
| `db/init.sql` | An **optional** reference schema for the `library` table - use it, or use EF Core migrations. |
| `sample-books-10.csv`, `sample-books-20.csv` | Sample data to import (`name`, `author`, `genre`). |

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Web app → http://localhost:4200
- API → http://localhost:8080
- RabbitMQ management UI → http://localhost:15672 &nbsp;(`guest` / `guest`)
- PostgreSQL → `localhost:5432` &nbsp;(`library` / `library`, database `library`)

## Overview

Build a small **bulk-import** web application for a book library. A user **drag-and-drops a CSV** of
books into the Angular UI; the **.NET API** publishes the rows to **RabbitMQ**; a **separate worker
service** consumes them and inserts each book into a **PostgreSQL** `library` table. The UI also shows
a **list of imported books** - name, author, genre, and import date. Everything is wired together with
**Docker Compose** so the whole app comes up with a single `docker compose up -d --build`.

This mirrors how we actually work: an API that hands work off to a queue, a separate worker that does
the persistence, and an Angular portal on top. We care far more about clean, correct, well-reasoned
code than about feature count - **polish beyond the requirements is not expected.**

---

## Requirements

### Server (.NET / ASP.NET Core)

1. Build a REST API with **.NET 10 and ASP.NET Core** (C#).
2. Implement these endpoints:
   - `POST /api/imports` - accepts an uploaded CSV (`multipart/form-data`), parses the rows, and
     **publishes them to RabbitMQ**. The API must **not** insert books into the database itself. Return
     promptly (e.g. `202 Accepted`) with the number of rows queued.
   - `GET /api/books` - returns the books in the `library` table (name, author, genre, import date),
     ordered by import date descending.
3. The CSV has three columns - **name**, **author**, **genre** - with a header row (see the provided
   `sample-books-10.csv` and `sample-books-20.csv`).
4. Handle the obvious errors sensibly - no file, wrong content type, empty CSV - with appropriate
   status codes.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

1. A single table, **`library`**, with at least: an id, `name`, `author`, `genre`, and `import_date`.
2. `import_date` is the moment the book was imported (set when the row is inserted), stored in UTC.
3. Use whichever data-access approach you prefer - **EF Core** (matches our stack), Dapper, or Npgsql.
   How the schema is created is your call: an EF migration or the provided `db/init.sql` init script
   are both fine.

### Messaging (RabbitMQ)

1. The API **publishes** the parsed rows to a RabbitMQ queue - e.g. one `BookImport` message per row
   carrying `{ name, author, genre }`. Keep messages small (the rows, not the raw file).
2. A **separate consumer/worker service** consumes those messages and **inserts each book** into the
   `library` table, stamping `import_date`. The worker must be a **genuinely separate runnable
   process/project** - not a `BackgroundService` hosted inside the API - and it must go through a real
   RabbitMQ broker (no in-process/in-memory queue).
3. This producer → queue → consumer handoff is the main thing we're assessing: **the API parses and
   publishes; the worker persists.**

### Client (Angular)

1. Build the UI with **Angular** (via `@angular/cli`). This is required - it's our stack.
2. Implement these features:
   - A **drag-and-drop** area to drop a CSV file (a click-to-browse fallback is welcome), which
     uploads to `POST /api/imports`.
   - A **list/table of books** showing **name, author, genre, and import date**, populated from
     `GET /api/books`.
   - The list should reflect newly imported books. Because the worker inserts rows asynchronously,
     **poll `GET /api/books` every couple of seconds** after an upload rather than refreshing once.
3. **Styling** - use Tailwind CSS
4. **Dependencies** - besides your styling choice and whatever `@angular/cli` scaffolds, avoid extra
   3rd-party packages. Plain Angular **signals** are a great fit here; NgRx is unnecessary.

### Docker

1. Extend the provided `docker-compose.yml` so it runs the **entire application** - PostgreSQL,
   RabbitMQ, the API, the worker, and the Angular app - so that a single **`docker compose up -d --build`**
   brings everything up and the app is usable in the browser with no further steps.
2. Include a `Dockerfile` for the API, the worker, and the frontend. 
3. For local development you may also run the services directly (`dotnet run`, `ng serve`), but the
   path we grade is the single-command `docker compose up -d --build`.

## Assumptions You Can Make

To keep you moving - make these calls without overthinking them (and feel free to note your own):

- The CSV always has a header row; skip it.
- The `id` type is your choice (e.g. integer identity or UUID).
- Skip malformed or incomplete rows; the valid rows should still import. No de-duplication is required.
- `GET /api/books` is **eventually consistent** - books appear a moment after upload, once the worker
  has processed them. That short delay is expected and fine.
- "The API must not write to the DB" refers to **book inserts** (those happen only in the worker);
  reading for `GET /api/books` from the API is fine.
- Assume small CSVs (tens to low-hundreds of rows) - no batching, backpressure, or streaming needed.

---

## Bonus Points (only if you have time)

1. Drag-and-drop polish - highlight on drag-over, reject non-CSV files.
2. A few unit tests.
3. Graceful handling of RabbitMQ / PostgreSQL not being ready yet (connection retry on startup).

---

## What We're Looking For

- A clean **producer → RabbitMQ → consumer** split, with the **worker (not the API) doing the
  database writes**.
- **Clear, readable code** with sensible types (records/DTOs).
- A **working, easy-to-run app** over a feature-packed broken one.

---

## Definition of Done

A quick self-check before you submit:

1. Dropping a CSV in the UI results in the books appearing in the list (within a few seconds), each
   with name, author, genre, and import date.
2. The API process never inserts into PostgreSQL - the **separate worker** does, after consuming from
   RabbitMQ.
3. A single `docker compose up -d --build` brings up the entire app (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, API, worker,
   and UI), usable in the browser with no further steps.

---

## Submission

1. **Fork this repository** and build your solution in your fork.
2. Add a short **`SOLUTION.md`** (or a section at the top of this README) covering: how to run it, any
   assumptions or design decisions you made, and anything you'd improve with more time.
3. Make sure `docker compose up -d --build` brings up the whole stack.
4. Send us the link to your fork. If your fork is private, grant read access to **`marianchelmus`**.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Code quality and clarity.
2. Functionality and completeness for the given scope.
3. The RabbitMQ producer/consumer design - the worker does the persistence.
4. Usability and overall polish.
5. Proper use of C# / .NET, Angular, PostgreSQL, and 3rd-party packages.

Good luck - we're looking forward to seeing how you think.
